Ecosystem Edge NVIDIA-CI - Golang Automation CI
=======
# NVIDIA-CI

## Overview
This repository is an automation/CI framework to test NVIDIA operators, the GPU Operator and Network Operator.
This project is based on golang + [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo) framework.

### Project requirements
Golang and ginkgo versions based on versions specified in `go.mod` file.

The framework in this repository is designed to test NVIDIA's operators on a pre-installed OpenShift Container Platform
(OCP) cluster which meets the following requirements:

* OCP cluster installed with version >=4.12

### Supported setups
* Regular cluster 3 master nodes (VMs or BMs) and minimum of 2 workers (VMs or BMs)
* Single Node Cluster (VM or BM)
* Public Clouds Cluster (AWS, GCP and Azure) - For GPU Operator Only
* On Premise Cluster

### General environment variables
#### Mandatory:
* `KUBECONFIG` - Path to kubeconfig file.
#### Optional:
* Logging with glog

We use glog library for logging. In order to enable verbose logging the following needs to be done:

1. Make sure to import inittool package in your go script, per this example:

<sup>
    import (
      . "github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/nvidia-ci/internal/inittools"
    )
</sup>

2. Need to export the following SHELL variable:
> export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100

##### Notes:

  1. The value for the variable has to be >= 100.
  2. The variable can simply be exported in the shell where you run your automation.
  3. The go file you work on has to be in a directory under github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/nvidia-ci/tests/ directory for being able to import inittools.
  4. Importing inittool also initializes the api client and it's available via "APIClient" variable.

* Collect logs from cluster with reporter

We use k8reporter library for collecting resource from cluster in case of test failure.
In order to enable k8reporter the following needs to be done:

1. Export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS and set it to true. Use example below
> export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true

2. Specify absolute path for logs directory like it appears below.  By default /tmp/reports directory is used.
> export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/logs_directory

## How to run

The test-runner [script](scripts/test-runner.sh) is the recommended way for executing tests.

### Environment variables

General Parameters for the script are controlled by the following environment variables:
- `TEST_FEATURES`: list of features to be tested.  Subdirectories under `tests` dir that match a feature will be included (internal directories are excluded).  When we have more than one subdirectory ot tests, they can be listed comma-separated.- _required_
- `TEST_LABELS`: ginkgo query passed to the label-filter option for including/excluding tests. Supports comma-separated labels (AND logic) and `||` operator (OR logic). Examples: `'nvidia-ci,gpu'`, `'nvidia-ci,mps'`, `'nvidia-ci,mig'`, `'deploy || rdma-legacy-sriov'` - _optional_
- `TEST_VERBOSE`: executes ginkgo with verbose test output - _optional_
- `TEST_TRACE`: includes full stack trace from ginkgo tests when a failure occurs - _optional_
- `VERBOSE_SCRIPT`: prints verbose script information when executing the script - _optional_
- `NO_COLOR`: `{true|anything else}` when used, omits the coloring of logs that appear on beginning of the functions. However it does not affect on the coloring of the logs that ginkgo framework generates. - _optional_

NVIDIA GPU Operator-specific parameters for the script are controlled by the following environment variables:
- `NVIDIAGPU_GPU_MACHINESET_INSTANCE_TYPE`: Use only when OCP is on a public cloud, and when you need to scale the cluster to add a GPU-enabled compute node. If cluster already has a GPU enabled worker node, this variable should be unset.

- `NVIDIAGPU_USE_PRECOMPILED_DRIVER`: boolean flag to enable precompiled/signed driver testing. When set to `true`, the test discovers the latest precompiled driver version from `registry.redhat.io/nvidia/gpu-driver-rhel9` and patches the ClusterPolicy to use it - Default value is `false` - _optional_
- `NVIDIAGPU_PRECOMPILED_DRIVER_BRANCH`: controls which precompiled driver branch(es) to test (only applies when `NVIDIAGPU_USE_PRECOMPILED_DRIVER=true`). When empty (default), tests the first discovered branch. Set to `all` to test all discovered branches (deduplicated by major version). Set to a comma-separated list (e.g. `580.178.04,595.91.07`) to test specific branches. Each branch runs a full GPU burn validation - _optional_

### CLI parameters:

NVIDIA MIG parameters for the script are controlled by the following ginkgo parameters which are delivered as `ARGS="-- [{parameter}...]"` for the `make run-tests` (check the examples):
- `--single.mig-profile=n`, where n is typically a value of int type between 0-5. The parameter is used to choose the MIG profile from list of available MIG profiles (e.g. 1g.5gb is usually referenced with index 0).  If not specified, a valid random number is used. Typically values 0-5. - _optional_
- `--mixed.mig.instances=xxx`, where xxx is a comma-separated string inside quotation marks (e.g. "2,0,1,1,0,0") The list of numbers represent how many instances are to be used for each profile when creating a pod. The first number indicates how many instances are to be used for the first profile etc. The instances of different profiles consume GPU slices in a different way. The name of the profile (e.g. 2g.10gb) describes the consumption of each instance (each instance would consume 2 slices and 10gb of memory). _optional_
- `--mixed.mig.pod-delay=n`, where n is a number in range 0 - 315 (seconds). In mixed MIG testcase there are usually more than 1 pod launched (depends on available GPU and mixed.mig.instances parameter). Since GPU workload is 300 seconds, this parameter can be used to control the delay between the pod launches so that the pods are running completely simultaneously, mostly overlapping (e.g. 15-80), slightly overlapping (e.g. 200-280 seconds), or non-overlapping (over 300 seconds). Values outside valid range are reset to closest limit (either 0 or 315). _optional_

### Testing MPS with GPU Operator

To test the Multi-Process Service (MPS) functionality, you need to first deploy the GPU Operator and then run the MPS tests without cleaning up the GPU Operator deployment between test suites.

It is recommended to execute the runner script through the `make run-tests` make target.

#### Steps to run MPS tests:

1. First, deploy the GPU Operator with cleanup disabled for example:
```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true
$ export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/nvidia-ci-gpu-logs-dir
$ export TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,gpu'
$ export TEST_TRACE=true
$ export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100
$ export NVIDIAGPU_GPU_MACHINESET_INSTANCE_TYPE="g4dn.xlarge"
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CATALOGSOURCE="certified-operators"
$ export NVIDIAGPU_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANNEL="v23.9"
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false  # Important: don't clean up after deployment
$ make run-tests
```
2. After the GPU Operator deployment completes successfully, run the MPS tests:
```bash
$ export TEST_FEATURES="mps"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,mps'  # Run MPS-specific tests
$ make run-tests
```
The MPS tests will use the existing GPU Operator deployment that was left in place from the previous test run. This ensures that the MPS tests can properly validate MPS functionality on an already configured GPU environment.

#### Test Suite Ordering:

The test framework ensures that the GPU Operator deployment tests run before MPS tests through Ginkgo's ordering mechanisms. If you need to add new MPS tests, make sure they are organized to run after the GPU Operator deployment by using proper labeling and ordering in your test files.

#### Cleanup:

After completing the MPS tests, you may want to clean up all resources. Re-run the base
`nvidiagpu` deploy testcase with `NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=true`:
```bash
$ export TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,gpu'
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=true
$ make run-tests
```
This removes NFD, the GPU Operator (namespace, Subscription, OperatorGroup, CSV,
ClusterPolicy), and any leftover gpu-burn resources.

### Testing MIG with GPU Operator

To test the Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) functionality, you need to first deploy the GPU Operator and then run the MIG tests without cleaning up the GPU Operator deployment between test suites.

It is recommended to execute the runner script through the `make run-tests` make target.

#### Steps to run MIG tests:

1. Run mig testcases (single-mig and mixed-mig) after nvidia-ci on any cluster, while selecting single.mig.profile=1
```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true
$ export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/nvidia-ci-gpu-logs-dir
$ export TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,gpu,single-mig,mixed-mig'
$ export TEST_TRACE=true
$ export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false
$ make run-tests ARGS="-- --single.mig.profile=1"
```
2. Running only MIG testcases on an existing cluster which has GPU operator installed,
e.g. after executing step 1. MIG testcase(s) can be used from either nvidiagpu or
mig package. MIG is used in this example. In the other case, use `TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"`
to execute the testcase from nvidiagpu package.
With these MIG parameters single-mig testcase would choose a random MIG profile (as the single.mig.profile is not
included) , mixed-mig testcase would use 1 instance amount for A100 GPU (1x 1g.5gb, 1x 2g.10gb and 1x 3g.20gb,
leaving the second profile 1g.10gb unused).
mixed-mig testcase would wait 35 seconds between the pods launching with mixed.mig.pod-delay parameter
You can deliver the ginkgo cli parameter using ARGS after the "make run-tests"
```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true
$ export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/nvidia-ci-gpu-logs-dir
$ export TEST_FEATURES="mig"
$ export TEST_LABELS='single-mig,mixed-mig'
$ export TEST_TRACE=true
$ export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false
$ make run-mig-tests ARGS="-- --mixed.mig.instances='1,0,1,1' --mixed.mig.pod-delay=35"
```

#### Cleanup:

If the GPU operator and gpu burn pod need to be cleaned up, just set `NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=true`
in the last execution of either steps 1 or 2.

### Testing Time-Slicing with GPU Operator

To test GPU time-slicing, deploy the GPU Operator first, then run the time-slicing tests.
The test creates a device plugin ConfigMap with time-slicing configuration, deploys a
ClusterPolicy referencing it, and validates that multiple CUDA workloads run concurrently
on a single time-sliced GPU.

#### Steps to run time-slicing tests:

1. Deploy the GPU Operator with cleanup disabled (same as MPS step 1 above)
2. Run the time-slicing tests:
```bash
$ export TEST_FEATURES="timeslicing"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,timeslicing'
$ make run-tests
```

### Testing native DRA with GPU Operator

Starting with GPU Operator **26.7.0**, DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) enablement can be
managed natively by the operator through two new custom resources, `NVIDIADriver` and
`GPUCluster`, instead of `ClusterPolicy`. The `native-dra` testcase (in the `nvidiagpu`
feature/suite, `tests/nvidiagpu`) deploys the GPU Operator and validates this stack.

It is a self-contained alternative to the base `"Deploy NVIDIA GPU Operator with DTK"`
testcase above — the two are mutually exclusive ways of installing/configuring the same GPU
Operator (`ClusterPolicy` is never created by `native-dra`, and vice versa) — so run it with
only the `native-dra` label selected, not together with the `gpu` label. Unlike the pre-release
DRA suites (`tests/dra/gpuallocation`, `tests/dra/computedomain`), which assume a
`ClusterPolicy` is already deployed and install the DRA driver separately via a Helm chart,
`native-dra` lets the GPU Operator manage the DRA driver itself.

#### What it does

1. Installs NFD, the same way the base testcase does.
2. Installs the GPU Operator via OLM (namespace, OperatorGroup, Subscription, waits for the
   operator Deployment and its CSV to succeed) — reusing the same `NVIDIAGPU_CATALOGSOURCE`/
   `NVIDIAGPU_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANNEL` variables as the base testcase.
3. Checks whether the installed GPU Operator version serves the `GPUCluster` CRD. If it
   doesn't (i.e. the installed version is < 26.7.0), the test is skipped.
4. Creates a minimal `NVIDIADriver` and a minimal `GPUCluster` custom resource, built directly
   from the CSV's `alm-examples` (the operator's own suggested minimal samples), and waits for
   both to reach the `ready` state.
5. Validates GPU functionality by executing `nvidia-smi` inside the driver pod(s) rendered by
   `NVIDIADriver`.

#### Steps to run the native DRA testcase:

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true
$ export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/nvidia-ci-gpu-logs-dir
$ export TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"
$ export TEST_LABELS='native-dra'
$ export TEST_TRACE=true
$ export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CATALOGSOURCE="certified-operators"
$ export NVIDIAGPU_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANNEL="v26.7"  # must resolve to GPU Operator >= 26.7.0
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false
$ make run-tests
```

#### Cleanup:

By default (`NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=true`), the GPUCluster, NVIDIADriver, CSV, Subscription,
OperatorGroup, GPU Operator namespace and NFD are all removed at the end of the run. To leave
them in place for inspection (e.g. to manually inspect the rendered DRA driver pods, or debug
a failure), set `NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false` (same variable used by the base testcase). See
[Cleaning up leftover resources](#cleaning-up-leftover-resources) below.

### Cleaning up leftover resources

If you ran any `nvidiagpu` testcase with `NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false` (e.g. to chain into MPS/MIG/
time-slicing, or to leave resources in place for debugging) and now want to remove everything,
re-run the same testcase with `NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=true`. If the GPU Operator/NFD are already
installed and ready, this completes quickly (no full redeployment) and then runs the same
`AfterAll` cleanup a normal run performs, removing NFD, the GPU Operator (namespace,
Subscription, OperatorGroup, CSV, ClusterPolicy and/or NVIDIADriver/GPUCluster, whichever was
deployed), and any leftover gpu-burn resources.

**Known issue**: `AfterAll`'s automatic cleanup (triggered when `NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=true`, the
default) can occasionally report a spurious failure like `Error cleaning up NFD resources:
failed to delete NFD CR: NodeFeatureDiscovery object nfd-instance doesn't exist in namespace
openshift-nfd` — this is a timing race in NFD's own delete-and-wait cleanup logic
(`pkg/nfd/deploynfd.go`), not an actual test failure; the resource in question was in fact
successfully deleted (tracked for a separate PR). If you see this, simply re-run the same
command again to confirm cleanup completed.

### Examples of Testing GPU Operator end-to-end

Example running the end-to-end GPU Operator test case:
```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true
$ export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/nvidia-ci-gpu-logs-dir
$ export TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,gpu,single-mig,mixed-mig'
$ export TEST_TRACE=true
$ export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100
$ export NVIDIAGPU_GPU_MACHINESET_INSTANCE_TYPE="g4dn.xlarge"
$ export NVIDIAGPU_CATALOGSOURCE="certified-operators"
$ export NVIDIAGPU_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANNEL="v23.9"
$ make run-tests

scripts/test-runner.sh
ginkgo -timeout=24h --keep-going --require-suite -r -vv --trace --label-filter="nvidia-ci,gpu,single-mig,mixed-mig" ./tests/nvidiagpu
```

### Examples of Testing GPU Operator upgrade

Example running the GPU Operator upgrade testcase (from v23.6 to v24.3) after the end-end testcase.
Note:  you must run the end-to-end testcase first to deploy a previous version, set NVIDIAGPU_CLEANUP=false,
and specify the channel to upgrade to NVIDIAGPU_SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADE_TO_CHANNEL=v24.3, along with the label
'operator-upgrade' in TEST_LABELS.  Otherwise, the upgrade testcase will not be executed:
```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DUMP_FAILED_TESTS=true
$ export REPORTS_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/nvidia-ci-gpu-logs-dir
$ export TEST_FEATURES="nvidiagpu"
$ export TEST_LABELS='nvidia-ci,gpu,operator-upgrade'
$ export TEST_TRACE=true
$ export VERBOSE_LEVEL=100

## Applying day-2 manifests to an existing cluster

Separate from the Ginkgo test suites above, [`scripts/apply-manifests.sh`](scripts/apply-manifests.sh)
applies (or deletes) a directory of plain YAML manifests against an already-installed OpenShift
cluster, via the `make apply-manifests` / `make delete-manifests` targets. This is intended for
one-off, day-2 cluster configuration (e.g. worker `MachineConfig`s, `ServiceAccount`s) that isn't
part of a Ginkgo test flow.

### Environment variables

- `KUBECONFIG` - Path to kubeconfig file - _required_ (same variable used everywhere else in this repo)
- `MANIFEST_DIR` - Directory containing the `*.yaml`/`*.yml` files to apply/delete - Defaults to `manifests` - _optional_
- `MANIFEST_VARS` - Space-separated list of `$VAR` tokens (`envsubst`'s own filter syntax) restricting variable substitution to only those variables. If unset, every variable present in the environment is eligible for substitution in every manifest - _optional_
- `WAIT_FOR_WORKER_MCP` - `{true|false}` - When `true` and the action is `apply`, waits for the worker `MachineConfigPool` to finish rolling out after each manifest is applied, before moving on to the next one. `make apply-manifests` defaults this to `true` (since the default `MANIFEST_DIR=manifests` contains `MachineConfig`s that reboot workers); the underlying script itself defaults to `false` - _optional_
- `WORKER_MCP_NAME` - Name of the `MachineConfigPool` to wait on when `WAIT_FOR_WORKER_MCP=true` - Defaults to `worker` - _optional_
- `WORKER_MCP_ROLLOUT_START_TIMEOUT` - How long to wait for the pool to *start* updating before giving up and moving on (tolerant: a manifest that doesn't touch worker `MachineConfig`s, like a `ServiceAccount`, never makes the pool start updating, so this timeout is expected to elapse harmlessly for those files) - Defaults to `2m` - _optional_
- `WORKER_MCP_ROLLOUT_TIMEOUT` - How long to wait for the pool to *finish* updating once it starts (fatal: the whole run aborts if this elapses) - Defaults to `40m` - _optional_

### Manifest file conventions

- **Ordering**: files are applied in lexical filename order (reverse order on delete), so prefix
  files with numbers (`00-`, `10-`, `20-`, ...) to control ordering when one manifest depends on
  another (e.g. a namespace before objects created in it).
- **Templating**: manifests may contain `${VAR}` / `$VAR` placeholders, substituted from the
  current environment via `envsubst` before being applied.
- **Required variables** (`<name>.env-required`): if a sibling file with the same base name and
  a `.env-required` extension exists next to a manifest (e.g. `10-foo.yaml` ->
  `10-foo.env-required`, one variable name per line, blank lines and `#`-comments ignored), the
  script verifies every listed variable is set and non-empty before rendering that manifest,
  failing fast instead of letting `envsubst` silently substitute an empty string for a variable
  nobody remembered to export.
- **Post-apply hooks** (`<name>.sh`): if a sibling file with the same base name and a `.sh`
  extension exists next to a manifest (e.g. `20-foo.yaml` -> `20-foo.sh`), it is executed
  immediately after that manifest is applied (and after any `WAIT_FOR_WORKER_MCP` wait
  completes). This is how manifest-specific follow-up commands are attached without hardcoding
  them into the generic script.

### Manifests in `manifests/`

- `00-doca1-99-machine-config-blacklist-irdma.yaml` - `MachineConfig` (role `worker`) that
  blacklists the `irdma` kernel module.
- `10-doca1-99-machine-config-udev-network.yaml` - `MachineConfig` (role `worker`) that installs
  a udev rules file mapping specific NIC MAC addresses to interface names (`ib_rdma0`/
  `eth_rdma0`). The rules content is parameterized as base64 in `contents.source`, so
  `DOCA1_UDEV_NETWORK_RULES_BASE64` **must be exported** before running `make apply-manifests`
  (enforced by the sibling `10-doca1-99-machine-config-udev-network.env-required` file) - _required_
- `20-doca1-rdma-service-account-default-namespace.yaml` - `ServiceAccount` named `rdma` in the
  `default` namespace. Its sibling hook script,
  `20-doca1-rdma-service-account-default-namespace.sh`, grants that ServiceAccount the
  `privileged` SCC (`oc -n default adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z rdma`) right after
  it's created.

### Example: apply all DOCA manifests

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ export DOCA1_UDEV_NETWORK_RULES_BASE64="$(base64 <<'EOF' | tr -d '\n'
SUBSYSTEM=="net",ACTION=="add",ATTR{address}=="<mac>",ATTR{type}=="1",NAME="ib_rdma0"
SUBSYSTEM=="net",ACTION=="add",ATTR{address}=="<mac>",ATTR{type}=="1",NAME="eth_rdma0"
EOF
)"
$ make apply-manifests
```

The two `MachineConfig` files each trigger a worker `MachineConfigPool` rollout (cordon/drain/
reboot/uncordon per node); with the default `WAIT_FOR_WORKER_MCP=true`, `make apply-manifests`
waits for that to finish after each one before moving on. After the last file
(`20-doca1-rdma-service-account-default-namespace.yaml`) is applied, the SCC grant hook runs
automatically.

To remove everything again:

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
$ make delete-manifests
```

`delete-manifests` does not wait on the `MachineConfigPool` or run any hooks — it only removes
the manifests themselves, in reverse order.
